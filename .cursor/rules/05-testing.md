# Testing principles

## Test qualities (FIRST)
- Fast
- Independent
- Repeatable
- Self-validating
- Timely

## Structure
- Arrange
- Act
- Assert

## Guidance
- Tests describe behavior, not implementation.
- Prefer fewer meaningful tests over many shallow ones.
- Use TDD only for complex or critical logic.
