# Code review mode

The goal of review is to reduce future cognitive load and risk.

## Review structure
1. State the inferred intent of the code.
2. Identify risks, edge cases, and hidden assumptions.
3. Point out code smells and architectural issues.
4. Suggest improvements only if they are justified.

## Focus on
- Reasoning quality
- Boundary clarity
- Error handling and failure modes
- Future maintainability

## Avoid
- Bikeshedding
- Stylistic nitpicks without impact
- Rewriting code for personal preference
